\item Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers. Let $a_1, a_2, $\dots$ , a_m$ be distinct elements of $\{1, 2, \dots , n\}$ such that whenever $a_i + a_j \leq n$ for some $i, j, 1 \leq i \leq j \leq m$, there exists $k, 1 \leq k \leq m$, with $a_i + a_j = a_k$. Prove that 

$\frac{a_1+a_2+\dots+a_m}{m} \geq \frac{n+1}{2}$.

\item $ABC$ is an isosceles triangle with $AB = AC$. Suppose that 

1. $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$ and $O$ is the point on the line $AM$ such that $OB$ is perpendicular to $AB$;

2. $Q$ is an arbitrary point on the segment $BC$ different from $B$ and $C$;

3. $E$ lies on the line $AB$ and $F$ lies on the line $AC$ such that $E$, $Q$, $F$ are distinct and collinear.

Prove that $OQ$ is perpendicular to $EF$ if and only if $QE=QF$.

\item For any positive integer $k$, let $f(k)$ be the number of elements in the set $\{ k+1, k+2, \dots, 2k \}$ whose base $2$ representation has precisely three $1s$. 

$\bullet$ $(a)$ Prove that, for each positive integer $m$, there exists at least one positive integer $k$ such that $f(k)=m$.

$\bullet$ $(b)$ Determine all positive integers $m$ for which there exists exactly one $k$ with $f(k)=m$.

\item Determine all ordered pairs $(m,n)$ of positive integers such that

$\frac{{n^{3}}+1}{mn-1}$ 

is an integer.

\item Let $S$ be the set of real numbers strictly greater than $-1$. Find all functions $f : S \rightarrow S$  satisfying the two conditions:

$1$. $f(x + f(y) + xf(y)) = y + f(x) + yf(x)$ for all $x$ and $y$ in $S$; 


2. $\frac{f(x)}{x}$ is strictly increasing on each of the intervals $-1<x<0$ 

and $0<x$.

\item Show that there exists a set $A$ of positive integers with the following property: For any infinite set {S} of primes there exist two positive integers $m$ $\epsilon$ $A$ and $n \notin A$ each of which is a product of $k$ distinct elements of $S$ for some $k \geq 2$.
